My second React.js app. This a goal adder and remover.

The goal is to add dynamic CSS styling, on top of using `UseState` React hook.

This includes all of the node_modules, which bloats the package but there should be no dependency issues. In order to see the app, you must have `Node.js` and should run `npm start` in the root directory.
